# Installation

BlazePwifi 0.3.0-rc.1 is built against OpenWrt 25.12.5. Verify the exact device revision and a recovery path before flashing.

## First login

Default account name: admin.

There is no universal production password. A fresh image generates a random bootstrap password at first boot and stores it root-only at:

    /etc/blazepwifi/INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD

Read it locally or over SSH:

    cat /etc/blazepwifi/INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD

Sign in and replace it immediately. The bootstrap file is removed after password replacement.

Default endpoints:
- Portal: http://LAN_IP:8080/
- Admin: https://LAN_IP:8443/admin.html
- Vendo API: http://LAN_IP:4455/cgi-bin/vendo
- Rental API: http://LAN_IP:8080/cgi-bin/rental

Administration is HTTPS-only and local-management-side by default.

## Existing OpenWrt 25.12.x

1. Back up OpenWrt and confirm recovery access.
2. Copy the BlazePwifi project directory to the router.
3. Run installer/install.sh as root.
4. Save the printed bootstrap admin credential and Vendo key.
5. Sign in, replace the bootstrap password, then configure network roles, rates and controllers.

## Network roles and VLANs

Everything below is configurable. Example production layout:

| Role | Example VLAN | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Management | 10 | Admin and SSH |
| Hotspot | 13 | Captive-portal clients |
| Controllers | 20 | ESP/Linux Vendos |
| Rental devices | 30 | Managed Android phones |
| WAN | upstream | Internet uplink |

Small Lite deployments can leave all VLAN IDs at 0 and use br-lan.

Relevant settings include management_if, hotspot_if, controller_if, rental_if and their VLAN IDs. Preserve an alternate management/recovery path before changing a remote management VLAN.

## ESP8266 controller

Reference defaults:
- coin input GPIO4
- relay GPIO5
- insert/status LED GPIO14
- coin active-low

These are editable. A 12 V coin acceptor must never be wired directly to a 3.3 V GPIO. Use proper isolation/level conditioning and validate voltage, polarity and pulse width on the real acceptor.

The controller exposes a temporary generated-password setup AP where Wi-Fi, server address, controller ID/key and GPIO mapping can be changed.

## ESP32 controller

Reference defaults:
- coin input GPIO27
- relay GPIO26
- LED GPIO2
- coin active-low
- relay/LED active-high
- debounce 40 ms
- pulse group 400 ms

ESP32 uses Preferences/NVS for settings and LittleFS for its unacknowledged coin journal. All listed GPIO/timing/polarity values are configurable.

## Orange Pi

Release-gating images:
- Orange Pi Zero 3
- Orange Pi One
- Orange Pi PC

Successful optional builds can include PC Plus, PC2, Zero, Zero2, Zero2W and One Plus.

Write the matching sdcard.img.gz image to microSD with Raspberry Pi Imager, Etcher, Rufus, or decompressed dd. Never flash an image for another board.

Standard images include the libgpiod controller agent, but it is not auto-enabled because physical header pin numbers are not gpiochip offsets. On the exact board:
1. run gpioinfo;
2. identify safe lines;
3. configure gpiochip + line offsets in BlazePwifi;
4. verify logic levels without the acceptor attached;
5. connect isolated hardware and enable the agent.

Orange Pi Zero 3 should use Ethernet or a verified supported external adapter unless the exact upstream build documents onboard wireless support.

## x86_64 PC

The release contains both legacy BIOS and UEFI images, with ext4 and squashfs variants when generated.

- combined.img.gz: legacy BIOS
- combined-efi.img.gz: UEFI

Write an image using Rufus, Etcher, or:

    gunzip -c IMAGE.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/DEVICE bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress

BlazePwifi does not rely on a fixed eth0 name. Assign actual detected interfaces to WAN, management and hotspot roles.

## Ruijie RG-EW1200G Pro v1.1

The release contains an official OpenWrt checksum-verified initramfs bootstrap and a BlazePwifi squashfs sysupgrade. The bootstrap does not contain the persistent BlazePwifi installation. Confirm the exact v1.1 hardware and serial/TFTP recovery before flashing.

## BlazeRental Android

### Strong QR / Device Owner mode

Use only an owned or explicitly authorized rental phone. Factory-reset it and enter Android QR provisioning during Setup Wizard. A real provisioning QR contains:
- BlazeRental DPC component;
- APK download URL;
- SHA-256 APK checksum;
- BlazePwifi server URL;
- one-time enrollment token;
- device label.

On supported Android/OEM builds, this provisions BlazeRental as Device Owner. Managed policy can apply the dedicated launcher, lock-task allowlist and supported restrictions. Rental time is server-authoritative; after reboot cached lease state fails closed until the server is reached.

### Manual APK mode

BlazeRental.apk can also be installed normally. It remains useful as the rental client, but it is intentionally labeled lower-security because normal installation cannot reliably prevent uninstall, settings access or safe-mode bypass.

Neither mode claims resistance to bootloader/recovery reflashing, privileged exploits or OEM service tools.

## Portal previews

Open portal-templates/index.html locally to browse static previews for first-run setup, admin, captive portal, rate selection, insert coin, voucher, active/pause states, Vendo/controller setup and rental enrollment/lock screens.

## Release verification

GitHub Release assets include a release-wide SHA256SUMS and manifest.json. Verify checksums before flashing or installing.

## Before accepting payment

Physically test exact-device boot/recovery, DHCP/DNS/captive behavior, VLAN isolation, controller voltage/polarity/pulse timing, GPIO isolation, brownouts during writes, duplicate/retry events, rental reboot/network-loss behavior, and sustained multi-client load.

CI-green means build-validated; it does not automatically mean field-proven.
