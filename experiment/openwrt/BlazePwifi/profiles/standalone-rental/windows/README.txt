BlazePwifi Standalone Rental Server - Windows One-Click Installer
Version: v0.5.2-rental.2-rc.7

1. Extract the ZIP completely.
2. Double-click Install-BlazePwifi-Rental.bat.
3. Enter the OpenWrt router IP/hostname, SSH username and password.
4. Confirm the router SSH host-key fingerprint on first connection.
5. The installer probes the board before deployment.
6. If it detects notion,r281 it automatically uses the R281/EasyMode-specific installation path.
7. Other supported OpenWrt devices use the generic target-detection path.

The R281 path is BusyBox-compatible and does not use GNU tar-only extraction options.

Normal Rental Standalone installation does not intentionally modify network, wireless or firewall UCI packages.

After installation:
  Rental console: https://ROUTER-IP/rental/
  Android server: http://ROUTER-IP

The SSH password is written only to a temporary local file for plink/pscp and is overwritten/deleted at the end of the run.

The package includes PuTTY command-line SSH tools (plink/pscp) solely for deployment. See the included PuTTY licence file.


Fresh-install Rental console credentials:
  Username: admin
  Password: admin

Existing admin accounts are preserved on upgrade. Change the default password later in Rental settings.


PASSWORD RESET:
  Double-click Reset-BlazePwifi-Admin-Password.bat.
  It works with Standalone Rental and full BlazePwifi.
  It resets only to:
    Username: admin
    Password: admin
  No manual file upload to the router is required.


HOTFIX 0.5.2-rental.2-rc.7:
- Fixes CSRF validation failures on mutating Rental admin actions such as QR enrollment.
- Sends CSRF in both HTTP header and POST body.
- Refreshes the authenticated session and retries once if a CSRF token becomes stale.


PROVISIONING RC:
  Standard Enrollment QR and Android Device Provisioning QR are separate.
  Device Provisioning uses the exact APK/checksum shipped with this release candidate.


DEVICE PROVISIONING RC7:
  Standard Enrollment QR and Android Device Provisioning QR are separate.
  Device Provisioning remains a release-candidate feature.
  The APK Setup Wizard checksum uses canonical padded Base64URL SHA-256.
  Google-certified Android may block a custom DPC that is not Android Enterprise approved.
  RC7 metadata declares that state and the Rental UI requires an explicit warning acknowledgement.
  Use the custom-DPC test path only on AOSP/non-GMS or an explicitly supported test device unless approval is declared.


RC7 ORIGIN HARDENING:
- OpenWrt validates Rental Server authorities before generating either QR type.
- Android independently re-validates the origin and TLS pin before persisting enrollment state.
- Missing hosts, nonnumeric/out-of-range ports, malformed IPv6, userinfo, paths, queries, fragments and backslashes are rejected.
